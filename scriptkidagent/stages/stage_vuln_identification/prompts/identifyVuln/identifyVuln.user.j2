You are provided with the following information about the target service:

Target SERVICE: {{SERVICE_REPORT_STR}}

Your task is to identify possible vulnerabilities associated with the target service.

You should always start with searching the exploit in metasploit, with execute_cmds_in_msfconsole function. 

If there are multiple vulnerabilities, you should identify all of them.

If the website_framework is not UNKNOWN, just focus on website_framework and website_framework_version.

This includes identifying vulnerabilities such as CVE IDs, CNVD IDs, or other relevant identifiers. For each vulnerability, provide a brief description of the issue, as well as details about the capabilities the vulnerability can provide (e.g., remote code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure).

Additionally, you should gather any additional information that could help in assessing the risk or exploiting the vulnerability. This may include the affected versions of the service, the severity of the vulnerability, patch availability, and known exploits. If possible, provide details about the framework, configuration, or environment that could contribute to the vulnerability.

You have access to a shell to assist you in gathering information. Use all possible methods to comprehensively identify vulnerabilities and their associated details.

You need to ensure that the vulnerability is accurately identified and that the information provided is relevant and detailed. If you cannot identify any possible vulnerability, put 'UNKNOWN' in the vulnerability_id field.
