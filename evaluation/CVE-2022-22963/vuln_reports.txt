  <vulnerability_description>Spring Cloud Function SpEL Injection allows remote code execution.</vulnerability_description>
  <capabilities>['Remote code execution']</capabilities>
  <additional_information>
    How to exploit in Metasploit: Use the module `exploit/multi/http/spring_cloud_function_spel_injection`.
      How to exploit using exploitdb to exploit: Not available.
      Framework: Spring
      Configuration: Requires a vulnerable Spring Cloud Function setup.
      Operating System: Cross-platform (Java-based).
      Environment: Typically found in cloud environments using Spring Cloud.
      Affected Versions: Spring Cloud Function versions prior to the patched release.
      Patch Availability: Patches are available from the Spring project.
